[VMPerf-To-Graphite]
================
A comprehensive PowerShell Script to read Virtual Machine statistics from vCenter and send the results to Graphite/Grafana. It pulls Disk and CPU metrics from the "Realtime" statistics in VCenter, aggregates the data and sends them to carbon (which is the data-receiver for Graphite). It is intended to run as a background task forever. It contains various error checking mechanisms and will not stop, even if VCenter or the Graphite servers are rebooted.

Please check all the available parameters with Get-Help -full.
